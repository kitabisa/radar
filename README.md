## What is the Tech Radar:

Kitabisa Tech Radar is a list technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called ring assignment. We use four rings with the following semantics:

- ADOPT - Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose. Technologies recommended to be widely used.
- TRIAL - Technologies that we have seen work in project. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky, some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experience.
- ASSESS - Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value add for us, technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact.
- HOLD - Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not yet worth to further invest in.

## What is the purpose?

The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at Kitabisa to pick the best technologies for our projects, it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape.

## Maintain

The Tech Radar is maintained by our Platform Lead - Quality Engineer.
